        MuggleTech LLC builds practical AI tools and a public website at muggletech.net. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have. By using our site, our Chrome extension J.A.N.E., or our forms, you agree to this policy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Information we collect</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-[var(--muted)]">
        <li>
          <strong>Site analytics.</strong> We use Plausible Analytics which is privacy friendly and cookie free. Plausible reports aggregated usage only. We do not see personal identities from Plausible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact or careers submissions.</strong> If you submit a form, we receive the fields you provide, for example name, email, message, and any links you choose to share. If you embed a Google Form, Google may collect additional technical data as described in their policy.

          <strong>Payments and donations.</strong> If you use our Buy Me a Coffee page, payment processing is handled by that provider. We receive your name or message if you choose to share it. We do not receive your full card details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Extension usage.</strong> J.A.N.E. runs locally in your browser. Content you view or analyze with the extension is processed on your device or by the model provider you configure in the extension. We do not use our marketing site to collect your resume content or job descriptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical logs.</strong> Our hosting platform may log standard server events such as IP address and user agent for security and reliability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">How we use information</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-[var(--muted)]">

      <p className="text-[var(--muted)]">
        We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards. No method of transmission or storage is fully secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
